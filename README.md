# blitzunlink

blitzunlink is a tool for converting BlitzBasic, BlitzPlus, BlitzMax, Blitz3D game bytecode into easier to reverse and mod DLLs

## How to use

0. Install mingw-w64 32-bit, this will be needed later.

1. Compile the `loader` branch of [my fork of Blitz3D](https://github.com/namazso/blitz3d_msvc2017)

2. Compile this project

3. Extract the `1111` ID RCDATA resource from the target game (you can use 7-Zip for this):

4. Convert the game code blob into a COFF object with this tool:

```
blitzunlink 1111 bbgame.obj
```

5. Link the COFF object into a DLL using `gcc`. `runtime.dll` is the file from the outputs of the Blitz3D compile:

```
gcc -s -shared -e_DllEntry -nodefaultlibs -nostdlib -Wl,--enable-runtime-pseudo-reloc-v1 -Wl,--unique=.rdata bbgame.obj runtime.dll -o bbgame.dll
```

6. Copy `runtime_ldr.exe`, `runtime.dll`, `bbgame.dll`, `fmod.dll` into the game folder.

7. Game should be functional when starting `runtime_ldr.exe`
